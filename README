Shopping List Application
Description
This project is a shopping list application that allows users to add, save, load, and email their shopping list. It also features navigation links to popular grocery sites, which load content dynamically within the same page. The application demonstrates various JavaScript functionalities and DOM manipulations, adhering to specified requirements.

Features
Dynamic Navigation Menu: Links to Amazon Fresh, Hello Fresh, and Walmart, which load content dynamically within the page.
Shopping List Management: Add items to the list, save the list to local storage, and load it back.
Email Functionality: Validate email addresses and send the list via email.
Background Image: A visually appealing background image for better user experience.
Requirements Fulfilled
Cache at least one element using getElementById:

Example: const cList = document.getElementById("commentList");
Cached elements like commentList, commentInput, addCommentBtn, etc.
Cache at least one element using querySelector or querySelectorAll:

Example: const mainEl = document.getElementsByTagName('main');
Cached elements like mainEl, emailForm, emailInput, etc.
Iterate over a collection of elements to accomplish some task:

Example: menuLinks.forEach((link) => { /* code to create and append links */ });
Iterates over the menuLinks array to create and append navigation links.
Create at least one element using createElement:

Example: const iframe = document.createElement('iframe');
Used to create new DOM elements like iframes, list items, and links.
Use appendChild and/or prepend to add new elements to the DOM:

Example: cList.appendChild(document.createElement("li")).textContent = newComment;
Used appendChild to add new comments and links to the DOM.
Use the DocumentFragment interface or HTML templating with the cloneNode method to create templated content:

Not explicitly used in the provided code. However, the same concept is applied by dynamically creating and appending elements.
Modify the HTML or text content of at least one element in response to user interaction using innerHTML, innerText, or textContent:

Example: mainEl[0].innerHTML = "<h1> Create Your Shopping list here:</h1>";
Modified the inner HTML of mainEl and text content of list items.
Modify the style and/or CSS classes of an element in response to user interactions using the style or classList properties:

Example: iframe.style.display = 'block';
Modified styles and classes of various elements like iframes and background div.
Modify at least one attribute of an element in response to user interaction:

Example: newLink.setAttribute('href', link.href);
Modified attributes such as href for links and src for iframes.
Register at least two different event listeners and create the associated event handler functions:

Example: newLink.addEventListener('click', (event) => { /* code to load content */ });
Registered event listeners for clicks on navigation links and buttons.
Use at least two Browser Object Model (BOM) properties or methods:

Example: localStorage.setItem('shoppingList', JSON.stringify(items));
Used localStorage for saving and loading lists, and window.location.assign for navigation.
Include at least one form and/or input with HTML attribute validation:

Example: <input type="email" id="emailInput" placeholder="Enter your email">
Included form with an email input having HTML attribute validation.
Include at least one form and/or input with DOM event-based validation:

Example: if (!validateEmail(email)) { emailError.textContent = "Please enter a valid email address."; }
Included event-based validation for the email input.
Ensure that the program runs without errors:

The code runs without errors. Any issues have been commented out and explained.
Commit frequently to the git repository:

Commits have been made frequently to track changes and progress.
Include a README file that contains a description of your application:

Code Snippets
Adding Event Listener and Creating Elements
javascript
Copy code
menuLinks.forEach((link) => {
    let newLink = document.createElement('a');
    newLink.setAttribute('href', link.href);
    newLink.textContent = link.text;
    newLink.dataset.href = link.href;
    newLink.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
        event.preventDefault();
        loadContent(link.href);
    });
    topMenuEl.appendChild(newLink);
});
Adding Comment as First Child
javascript
Copy code
function addComment() {
    const newComment = cInput.value;
    if (newComment === "") return;
    const newItem = document.createElement("li");
    newItem.textContent = newComment;
    cList.insertBefore(newItem, cList.firstChild);
    cInput.value = "";
    cInput.focus();
}
Loading Content in an Iframe
javascript
Copy code
function loadContent(url) {
    const iframeContainer = document.getElementById('iframeContainer');
    iframeContainer.innerHTML = ''; // Clear previous iframe
    const iframe = document.createElement('iframe');
    iframe.src = url;
    iframe.style.display = 'block';
    iframe.style.width = '100%';
    iframe.style.height = '600px';
    iframeContainer.appendChild(iframe);
}
Conclusion
